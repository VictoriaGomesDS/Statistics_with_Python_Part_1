# Statistics_with_Python_Part_1
A little about the notebook that I filled in the course on key concepts of statistics, such as mode, mean and median in practice. Ways of classifying the data and how the frequency distributions and variances apply to them.

This project consists of a Google Colab notebook filling done concurrently with the classes of the course Statistics with Python part 1: frequencies and measurements, taught by instructor Rodrigo Fernando Dias from Alura. 

In it we analyze the data made available by the National Household Sample Survey - 2015, where the data were already previously treated by the teacher, since the focus was on statistical manipulation.

To perform the analysis we used Python and the libraries pandas 1.3.5, numpy 1.21.5, seaborn 0.11.2 and scipy 1.4.1.

It was a very intense project and a lot of learning where I could have contact with several types of qualitative and quantitative variables. Frequency distribution for both types of variables. Measures of central tendency and their possible relationships. Separative measures and box-plot, and dispersion measures.

All this was well documented and explained in the notebook file =)
